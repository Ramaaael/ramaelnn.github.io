                <p class="post__details text-lg">It is important to treat the pain itself, 
                    and that will be followed by the growth of the patient, 
                    but at the same time there will be a lot of work and pain. 
                    To come down to the smallest detail, 
                    no one should undertake any work unless he derives some benefit from it. 
                    Don't be angry when you are reprimanded when you are happy, 
                    he wants a piece of sick hair in the hope that there will be no breeding. 
                    Unless they are blinded by lust, they do not appear; 
                    those guilty who abandoned their duty and softened their hearts, which is their work. 
                    But so that you may see where all the error springs from those who accuse pleasure and praise pain, 
                    I will open up the whole issue, and explain the things said by those discoverers of truth and, as it were, 
                    architects of a happy life. Because no one hates or abhors or runs away from pleasure because it is pleasure,
                    but because intense pain occurs in those who do not know how to follow pleasure with reason. 
                    Nor does anyone like pain because it is pain, chase after it, want to get it, but because such moments never come when he seeks great pleasure through toil and pain.
